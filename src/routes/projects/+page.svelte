<h1>Self-hosting/Server</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		Self-hosting different open-source services is something I am really interested in. I just
		recently started and already learned a ton. My Free Oracle Cloud Server in Frankfurt named Atlas
		has been running day and night without much trouble. I am using <a
			class="link"
			href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a
		>
		as a web server and using
		<a class="link" href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a> as the operating system. Nix and
		<a class="link" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>/<a
			class="link"
			href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a
		>
		make it really easy to deploy services. Just look at what it takes to setup Audiobookshelf for example:
		<a
			class="link"
			href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=services.audiobookshelf"
			>NixOS Audiobookshelf Options</a
		>.

<h1>Open-Source Contributions</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		I am a big fan of open-source software and I try to contribute to projects whenever I got the
		time and I find some bug or I am looking for a new feature. Sometimes these are just very small
		things. Sometimes I really get into it. I also like to contribute to the <a
			class="link"
			href="https://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a
		>
		when I notice something is wrong (<a
			class="link"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:StrangeGirlMurph">Wiki Userpage</a
		>). (Software) projects I contributed to (wrote code for) (the list of issues is much longer):

<h1>Coding Projects & monthly Jams</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		As I mentioned in the context of Jambo on the <a class="link" href="/work">work page</a>, I am
		part of Discord server where we do monthly coding jams. From there and just my every day life I
		have a whole repository full of small projects like riddles, challenges and all kinds of
		thingies. For example do I like to participate in the Advent of Code every year or do something
		fun for the Pi-Day. Most of the projects are not finished nor polished at all ðŸ™ƒ And that's
		okay! This is my having fun repository.

	<p>
		I guess this website is also one of my side projects. I build it with <a
			class="link"
			href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a
		>, <a class="link" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> and deployed it with
		<a class="link" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. First I tried using
		<a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/" class="link">Fresh</a>, Deno and Deno Deploy because I fell in
		love with Deno but I am just way too new to web development and wasn't up for it. Then I used
		<a href="https://nuxt.com/" class="link">Nuxt</a> but it wasn't a good fit either. I really don't
		like web development but it's kinda just what you have to learn in order to built things like this...
		I am pretty happy with SvelteKit now though :)
